title: "Crafter: Facial Feature Crafting against Inversion-based Identity Theft on Deep Models"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'With the increased capabilities at the edge (e.g., mo- bile device) and more stringent privacy requirement, it becomes a recent trend for deep learning-enabled applications to pre-process sensitive raw data at the edge and transmit the features to the backend cloud for further processing. A typical application is to run machine learning (ML) services on facial images collected from different individuals. To prevent identity theft, conventional methods commonly rely on an adversarial game-based approach to shed the identity information from the feature. However, such methods can not defend against adaptive attacks, in which an attacker takes a countermove against a known defence strategy. 

We propose Crafter, a feature crafting mechanism deployed at the edge, to protect the identity information from adaptive model inversion attacks while ensuring the ML tasks are properly carried out in the cloud. The key defence strategy is to mislead the attacker to a non-private prior from which the attacker gains little about the private identity. In this case, the crafted features act like poison training samples for attackers with adaptive model updates. Experimental results indicate that Crafter successfully defends both basic and possible adaptive attacks, which can not be achieved by state-of-the-art adversarial game-based methods'
