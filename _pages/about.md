I am a second year master student from [SEIEE](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received the B.S. degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes security and privacy issues in machine learning, and natrual language processing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liyao Xiang](http://xiangliyao.cn/) of [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)
